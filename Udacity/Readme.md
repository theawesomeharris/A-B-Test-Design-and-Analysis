This repo is the final project for completing the [A/B Test course by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257)https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257.  

In this repo, an A/B test has been designed and analyzed for the addition of a "free trial screener" after a user clicks on "Start Free Trial" button on a course overview page to test whether there will be improvements in the user experiece and tendency for users to stay on after the 14 days free trial period.  

The overview of the project is as follow:- 
- Experiment setup: define experiment goal, the null hypothesis H0, the alternative hypothesis H1 and unit of diversion.
- Experiment design: define invariant metrics, evaluation metrics, establish estimated baseline (population) metrics, set experiment sample size and experiment duration.
- Run the experiment
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the collected experiment data for Control and Experiment groups.
- Experiment analysis: Sanity checks, Effect Size Tests, Sign Tests.
- Conclusion and recommendation
